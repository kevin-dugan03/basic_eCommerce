basic_eCommerce
===============
This collection of files supports a basic eCommerce web application. It was developed using Java/J2EE, Javascript,
Tomcat, and a MySQL RDBMS. 

The solution uses a Front Controller with an MVC pattern. I developed basic diagrams to accompany the 
application - to include Use Case diagram, UML Class diagram, and EER Diagram. Patterns used in the application
include: 

MVC with Front Controller
Template View
Domain Model
Active Record
Data Mapper
Identity Map
Identity Field
Optimistic Offline Concurrency Lock
Session Server State

Application was developed on the Eclipse IDE and used Tomcat to deploy.
